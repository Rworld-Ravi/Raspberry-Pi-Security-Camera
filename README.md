# Raspberry-Pi-Security-Camera
This script requires custom hardware, which is included as a Fritzing/PNG files. Uses ePIR to detect motion. Emails a list of people when detected. Also is a Linphone server, so you can simultaneously connect to the camera for a live picture! (Right now is one-way on the Pi.)
